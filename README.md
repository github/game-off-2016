"Hacking horse" is a runner written in JavaScript. All you need to do to run this game is to download all the files from the repository and have a web-browser.

Why "Hacking horse"? â€” GitHUB: "You have the entire month of November to create a game loosely based on the theme hacking, modding and/or augmenting". The main word is "loosely". So after having read the wikipedia(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacking and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleasure_riding) we have decided to create a runner where the main character is a rider. 
The controls of the game: use spacebar for jumping. 

We hope you'll enjoy the riding!
