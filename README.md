# Lemth's submission for the GitHub Game Off 2016

## The Challenge
Create a game *loosely* based on the theme **hacking, modding and/or augmenting**.

Going for **modding** as in; *modificating* the speed of the player and objects around the player.

I'm **new to Git, GitHub, and version control**â€¦ (so I'm keeping these links for bookmark purposes)

* [Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/documentation) - everything you need to know about version control, and how to get started with Git.
* [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/) - everything you need to know about GitHub.
* Questions about GitHub? Please [contact our Support team][github-support] and they'll be delighted to help you.
* Questions specific to the GitHub Game Off? Please [create an issue][game-off-repo-issues]. This will be the official FAQ.

The official Twitter hashtag for the Game Off is `#ggo16`.

Cheers! <3
