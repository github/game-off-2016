# Console Cowboys.

## Setup
To setup this repo locally make sure to install Node + NPM

Run:
```npm install```

## Development

Run:
```npm start```

This will run a server so you can run the game in a browser.

Open your browser and enter [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) into the address bar.

Also this will start a watch process, so you can change the source and the process will recompile and refresh the browser

## Deployment

Run:

```npm run deploy```

and push to master

This will optimize and minimize the compiled bundle.
