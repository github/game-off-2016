# Game Design
2D side-scrolling, Metroidvania game.

# Game Story
Awoken from her slumber, Ursula rubs her eyes in an attempt to get her bearings. In what looks to be the remnants of an underground government laboratory, she slowly slumps off the experimentation table. Something inside not feel right, but she does not have a chance to investigate as the room starts collapsing. No longer constrained by her captors, she must make her way out of the crumbling, cacophonous caverns.
